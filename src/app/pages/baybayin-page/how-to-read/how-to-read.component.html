<h1>What is Baybayin?</h1>

<p>Baybayin was primarily used before the arrival of the Spanish colonists in the Philippines in the 16th century. The script is written in a way that each character represents a syllable rather than a single letter. The basic characters in Baybayin are called "kudlit" or diacritical marks, which are added to consonant characters to represent different vowel sounds.</p>
    
<p>Baybayin was written on various materials such as bamboo, leaves, and tree bark. It was commonly used for important documents, correspondence, and inscriptions on religious artifacts. However, after the Spanish colonization, the use of Baybayin declined and was eventually replaced by the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>Below is a chart (article linked below) of the symbols used in the transliteration I made. This form of Baybayin is called “Modified Baybayin” and is the most popular form of the script.</p>

<p>The first row of symbols above are vowels. These are typically used when a word starts with a vowel, like “ama”, or there are two consecutive vowels, like “maaari”. See below examples:</p>

<p>The second and third row of symbols show all of the consonants. By default all of the consonant symbols have an “a” after the associated consonant, making them “syllabic”. For example if you wanted to write the word “ba” or “ka” they would both be the ones symbol associated with the respective consonant without a kudlit. See below examples.</p>

<p>The final row of symbols gives examples on how the kudlits are used. If there is no kudlit (see above example) there is just an “a” after the consonant. If there is a kudlit above the symbol then the following vowel is either an “i” or “e”. If there is a kudlit below the following vowel is either an “o” or “u”. If there is a “krus” or “cross” kudlit below there is no following vowel, the symbol is treated as a stand-alone consonant.</p>

<p>In the word “filipino” the first symbols will have kudlits above because they are followed by “i”. The last symbol will have a kudlit below because it is followed by an “o”. See example below:</p>

<p>In the word “aking” the symbol for “ng” will have a krus kudlit below because it is not followed by a vowel. See example below:</p>
