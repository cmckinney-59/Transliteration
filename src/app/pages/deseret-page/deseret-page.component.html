    <p>The Deseret alphabet is a phonetic writing system developed in the mid-19th century by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) under the direction of church leaders, including Brigham Young. The alphabet was designed as a reform to the English writing system, aiming to improve literacy by providing a more phonetic representation of the sounds of English.</p>
